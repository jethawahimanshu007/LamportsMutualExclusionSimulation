# LamportsMutualExclusionSimulation
A simulation of Lamport's mutual Exclusion Algorithm in Java Swing and AWT
There are two zones separated by a bridge. All people are moving at random assigned speeds. Speeds of each node can varied by inputting in the text boxes. In the first part, only one person can cross a bridge at a time. In the second part, any number of people can cross the bridge at a time if all of them are moving in the same direction.
